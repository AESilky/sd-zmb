# Silky Design - Z80 Retro Computer

This is a Z80-based 'retro-style' Single Board Computer. In addition, there is a (complex) front-panel board that can read and write all the memory and I/O of the main board, and provides multiple peripheral devices using a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) micro-controller.
