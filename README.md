# Silky Design - Z80 Retro Motherboard

This is a Z80-based 'retro-style' Single Board Computer (motherboard).

The motherboard includes enough to run stand-alone. That includes:

1. Z80 CPU
2. Reset circuit, divided into a POR board/system reset and a Z80/CPU only reset
3. Memory Management Unit (MMU) that provides bank selecting 4 of 64 16K banks (4M physical address)
4. 512K bytes RAM and 512K bytes Flash ROM
5. 2 Serial ports with USB interface
6. Programmable BAUD rate generator
7. Periodic interrupt generated by 3rd CTC channel
8. RC2014-80 Extended/Enhanced Bus

The design started with much more on the board, but has been paired down to make the size and complexity of the board more reasonable. The 'features' that have been removed have been moved into projects of their own to be built-out as expansion boards.
