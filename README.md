# Silky Design - Z80 Retro Motherboard

This is a Z80-based 'retro-style' Single Board Computer (motherboard).

The motherboard includes enough to run stand-alone.
That includes:

1. Z80 CPU
2. Selectable CPU clock frequencies
3. Reset circuit, divided into a POR board/system reset and a Z80/CPU only reset
4. Memory Management Unit (MMU) that provides bank selecting 8 of 64 8K banks (2M physical address)
5. 512K bytes RAM and 512K bytes Flash ROM
6. 2 Serial ports. One with USB 'device' interface, one with USB host interface (KBD)
7. RP2040 module to provide USB Host (for a keyboard) and an SD Card interface. The SD Card can be used for:
   a. EEPROM (like) configuration storage
   b. Virtual IDE drive(s)
   c. Raw SD Card access
   d. Multicolor LED indicator (via the onboard NeoPixel)
8. Programmable BAUD rate generator
9. Periodic interrupt generated by 3rd CTC channel
10. OLED or TFT graphics display (can be used for graphics or multi-line text)
11. RC2014-80 Extended/Enhanced Bus

The design started with much more on the board, but has been paired down to make the size and complexity of the board more reasonable. The 'features' that have been removed have been moved into projects of their own to be built-out as expansion boards.
